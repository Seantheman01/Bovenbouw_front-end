        <p>"Sea of Thieves is a blast when playing with friends. 
            With its focus on cosmetic customisation, we slipped into the pirate's life with ease - even after six years of updates and seasonal changes. 
            Its natural and immersive approach to navigation makes it a seafaring sandbox well worth visiting, and a focus on cosmetics over high-tier loot make it a game you can play at your own pace. 
            It's a delight to steadily come to grips with the mechanics of the game too, whether that be how to outmanoeuvre enemy ships or sell your loot with quickened efficiency. 
            It might not have the same level of grind that a lot of players look for in a live service game, but there's endless pirate fun to be had here, and we're glad that PlayStation players finally have the opportunity to join in on the swashbuckling chaos."<br>

        <p>"Sea of Thieves is a pirate fantasy sandbox with an enormous amount of things to do, made unpredictable and exciting by the addition of other players. 
            Coordinating together across the deck of a massive pirate ship is pure chaos at times, but it's also endlessly entertaining. 
            The cosmetic-only progression system doesn't give you as much incentive to keep playing as I'd have liked and its free-form nature left me feeling lost at sea at times - but if you've got a good group of two or three friends to play with, it's hard to find a game as entertaining to jump aboard."<br>

        <p>"Since the game's launch over two years ago, Rare has worked continuously to build on Sea of Thieves' strong framework, and the countless features and systems they've added have all enhanced that core, undeniable truth. 
            They still have work to do, and for some players, it will never be enough. 
            But there are open seas and clear skies ahead. 
            For the current and future Pirate Legends out there--and even for the players who will never reach that level, but simply want to make some of their own tall tales out on the unforgiving waves--Sea of Thieves is finally a voyage worth embarking on."<br>
