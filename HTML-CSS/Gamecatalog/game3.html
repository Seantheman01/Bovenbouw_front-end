        <p>"This is a story - a collection of stories, really - about the decline of a way of life, as a small gang of outlaws tries ever harder to outrun the inexorable advance of American modernity, as well as the enemies and lawmen they have antagonised along the way...
            There can be no doubt that this is a landmark game. 
            It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video game worlds..."<br>

        <p>"It's a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that's patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it's combined with Rockstar's best storytelling to date. 
            Even after finishing the lengthy story I can't wait to go back and play more. 
            This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. 
            Looking for one of this generation's very best single-player action experiences? Here's your huckleberry."<br>
            -10/10 IGN

        <p>"Rockstar is the master of open-world building, of course, with nothing coming close to Grand Theft Auto V's urban sprawl until now. 
            Red Dead Redemption 2 feels more of an artistic challenge. 
            You will not find a better facsimile of Los Angeles than GTAV's Los Santos, but in a sense that world is already defined by artifice. 
            Creating something as natural as Red Dead Redemption 2 is a seismic achievement..."<br>
